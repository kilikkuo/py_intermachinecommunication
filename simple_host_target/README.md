# simple_host_target (python3 only for now)
A package which host and target server could be easily setup (I assume ...) in separate machine to dispatch task and execute then deliver results back.

   * Terminal 1
    ```shellscript
        $> python3 host.py
    ```

   * Terminal 2
    ```shellscript
        $> python3 target.py
    ```

   * Terminal 3
    ```shellscript
        $> python3 sample_project.py
        then press s + <enter>
    ```
